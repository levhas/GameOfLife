# GameOfLife
Just simple implementation of Conways game of Life using SFML for the graphics

This was one of my first projects in which I used OOP (and c++ in general), so the it has some messy code all over the place.
 

## How to run:
If you are on linux, SFML must be installed from your distros package manager.
I don't know if this will compile on Windows.

then compile and run the the project, like bellow. 
```
g++ -c main.cpp
g++ main.o -o GameOfLife -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
./GameOfLife
```
