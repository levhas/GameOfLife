# GameOfLife
Just simple implementation of Conways game of Life using SFML for the graphics

This old project is one of my first projects in which I used OOP (and c++ in general), so the it has some messy code all over the place.
 

## How to run:

for SFML to work, following dependenices are needed for linux:

    freetype
    x11
    xrandr
    udev
    opengl
    flac
    ogg
    vorbis
    vorbisenc
    vorbisfile
    openal
    pthread


g++ is needed for building

Build using the provided build.sh script and if that fails, manually building with cmake should work.

I don't know if this will compile on Windows.
